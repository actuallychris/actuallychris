        <h2>My Site Plan For a Weather Site</h2>
        <p></p>
        <h3>Mission Statement for the Weather Site</h3>
        <p>The purpose of this site is to help people be informed on the weather both in their local neighberhood and the areas around the country as a whole.</p>
        <section>
            <h2>Persona</h2>
            <p><strong>This is the typical person using this site.</strong></p>
            <p><strong>Name:</strong> John Doe</p>
            <h4>Demographics</h4>
            <p>I will use two generic groups of people. These two groups are young college students and your average buisness man.</p>
            <ul type="square">
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> College student age</li>
                <li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Single</li>
                <li><strong>Parent?:</strong> Nope</li>
                <li><strong>Education Status?:</strong> Currently in college</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Middle Age man</h3>
            <ul type="square">
                <li><strong>Age:</strong> Mid 40's</li>
                <li><strong>Marital Status:</strong> Married for 15 years</li>
                <li><strong>Parent?:</strong> Yes (5 kids)</li>
                <li><strong>Education Status?:</strong> Master's degree in buisness</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <p>
                <H2><strong>Who is the Target Audience:</strong></H2>
                <p>Almost everybody and their dog wants to know what the weather is like. For that reason, the target audience for this site will be anybody. If you were to get more specific, the audience that you would want to target to get the most ad revenue would be college students and the average buisness man. This is because both of these are trying to get places quickly (such as to work or to class) </p>

            <h2>Peer Review</h2>
            <p>Name: Jake Stewart</p>
            <br> Thoughts on my site to change:
            <ul>
                <li>Change the sketches.</li>
                <li>Improve the larger screen design</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <br> Did I change Them?: Yes
                <br> Why or Why Not?: I thought that the project for the larger screen should look as professional as the other screens.</p>
