2- An image (screenshot) of the mobile browser screen showing the design principle in use.
3- The site name used in the picture
4- A discussion of how the design principle is exemplified in the picture. Be detailed!

                The alignment of the CNN mobile webpage is pretty good. spacing for buttons on either side are centered, and there is a link for live TV on the top. Like the Disney site, CNN wants to you watch their live TV to make money. for the rest of the website, the aticles are neatly organized and its easy to read the titles on the small screen. The titles are aligned to the left with spacing so it's not touching the side, which makes it easier to read. Ads are located avery few articles in the list and is centered.
