                The Atonement is the most transcendant of all events in recorded human history. It is "one of the pillars of eternity," and because of the atonement, we can all be saved from our sins. While not allowing us to be saved IN our sins, we still can be forgiven and through that forgiveness, we can be happy.<br>In addition to the redeeming power, (or the power to save people FROM their sins) the Atonement also helps us overcome those trials before we are finished with them. For example, when you are struggling with an illness or even a temptation of any kind, you might reach out to God for help. This is where the Enabling power of the Atonement comes in. He will strengthen you to be able to overcome in the way that helps you the most.
