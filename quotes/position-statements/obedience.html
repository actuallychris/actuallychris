Obedience is the first law of heaven and it will continue to be the first law forever, for "God never changes." When we are obedient to the commandments, we are blessed, and if we are not obedient to the commandments, we suffer penalties. This is because, "There is a law irrevocably decreed in heaven upon which all blessings are predicated..." If we can understand that "sacrifice (or obedinece to the commandments) brings forth the blessings of heaven," we will begin to understand our purpose on earth here isn't just to gain agency, but it is also to help us understand how Heaven works when we become God's ourselves.
