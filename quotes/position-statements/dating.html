Dating...<br> Where do I even begin. Dating is the elephant in the room that nobody in the groups want to talk about but it is very important. This is because dating is what leads us to family. With family being central to our Creator's plan, you would think that dating were important. Well...Apostles seem to think so as well. They consistently have stressed the importance of dating. This was the specific reason why the church created YSA wards and branches. With the understanding, we can understand that the LDS church really wants us to date so that we can have families ourselves.
