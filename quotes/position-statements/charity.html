Charity is one of the most important virtues for us to understand and to emulate. "Charity is the Pure Love of Christ..." and "...suffers long, and is kind, envieth not, seeketh not her own..." All these traits are the traits of Jesus Christ. This love "endureth forever." If we are to develop this love, we are to "pray unto the father with all the energy of [our] hearts..." that we are able to have this love. <br> On a personal note about charity, I personally believe that if we are able to fully emulate the Savior's level of charity, it is in that moment that we will become perfected because we will love the Savior enough that we will not want to cause him harm.
