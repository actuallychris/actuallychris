                Education is important. I have learned that this is very important for us to learn. Joseph Smith once said 'Knowledge does away with darkness, [anxiety], and doubt; for these cannot exist where knowledge is.' This just proves the importance of education to me.<br> On a personal note, I personally agree with the statement that is found in  D&amp;C 130 where it says "... if a person gains more knowledge and intelligence in this life through his diligence and obedience than another, he will have so much the advantage in the world to come." Knowledge is the way that we can dispel darkness just like Joseph Smith once said.
