                Insofar as I can tell, it really seems as though the Lord has a real sense of humor. I know this may seem strange for us to say, but if you think about it, you will have a situation where you ask the lord for something, and he gives it to you...just not exactly what you were asking for. You might have asked him to help you grow your patience, and because of that, he gives you so many opportunities to grow your own patince. In other words, there are times where the wisdom of our Heavenly Father will be different from what we want.
